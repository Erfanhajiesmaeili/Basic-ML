# Basic Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the `basic_ml` directory! This folder serves as a repository for various machine learning projects I've undertaken to solidify my understanding of fundamental concepts and algorithms.

## Purpose

The primary goal of these projects is educational. They represent practical implementations of core machine learning techniques learned through courses, tutorials, or self-study. Each project aims to showcase the application of one or more algorithms on different datasets (often standard datasets like those from Scikit-learn or UCI ML Repository).

## Algorithms & Concepts Covered

The projects within this directory demonstrate the implementation and application of the following machine learning techniques:

### Regression
* **Linear Regression:** Modeling linear relationships between features and a continuous target variable.
* **Decision Tree Regression:** Using tree-based models for regression tasks.

### Classification
* **Logistic Regression:** Binary and multi-class classification using the logistic function.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classification based on the majority class among the nearest neighbors.
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Finding optimal hyperplanes to separate classes.
* **Naive Bayes:** Probabilistic classification based on Bayes' theorem with naive independence assumptions.
* **Decision Tree Classifier:** Using tree-based models for classification tasks.
* **Random Forest Classifier:** Ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees for classification.
* **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) / Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP):** Basic neural network structures for classification.

### Clustering
* **K-Means:** Unsupervised learning algorithm for partitioning data into K clusters.

### Dimensionality Reduction
* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Technique for reducing the number of features while preserving variance.

## Structure

Typically, each sub-directory or Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file within `basic_ml` corresponds to a specific algorithm or a small project utilizing one or more of these techniques.

## Usage

Most projects are implemented in Python using common data science and machine learning libraries such as:
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

To run the code, ensure you have Python and these libraries installed (preferably within a virtual environment). Specific requirements or setup instructions might be mentioned within individual project folders or notebooks if they differ.

Feel free to explore each directory to see how different machine learning techniques are applied and evaluated.
